The data for the app is handled in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Mr-Pepe/pengyou_data_generator). Follow the instructions there and copy the generated database file into /app/src/main/assets.

The stroke order diagrams make use of the [HanziWriter](https://hanziwriter.org/) project.

The handwriting recognitions makes use of the [Hanzi lookup](https://gugray.github.io/hanzi_lookup/) project.

Evelyn Li did an awesome job designing the app icon and user interface. Check out [her Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/evelyncplum/) to see more of her work.
